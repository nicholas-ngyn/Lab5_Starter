1.) No, I would not use unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because there are too many moving parts.
For example, there are functions responsible for sending, receiving, and processing messages to ensure they work correctly so it would be more
efficient to individually test those parts rather than the whole "message" feature as one.


2.) Yes, I would use unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application. The reason is because unit tests are ideal for testing specific functionalities or behaviors of individual components. And "max message length" is a specific behavior so you can write tests to verify that the message input field restricts the user from typing more than 80 characters, ensuring that the feature behaves as expected.
